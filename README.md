# Jenkins-pipeline-ways

We can create pipeline by two ways in Jenkins 
 1. Manual pipeline
 2. pipeline as code (automatic)


# Manual jenkins pipeline (jenkins WebUI):

For this jenkins give many plugins which give different view for pipeline .

for manual pipeline i install "Build pipeline plugin and Delivery pipeline plugin" and restart jenkins:

 Jenkins Dashboard -->> Manage jenkins -->> plugins
